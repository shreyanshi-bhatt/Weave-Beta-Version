## Welcome to Weave's GitHub Repo 🙋🏻‍♀️
Weave is a dynamic semi-formal social media platform that connects students and professionals worldwide, providing them with a space to share their academic achievements, industrial experiences, and collaborative opportunities.
## 1 Goal 💪🏻
To create a close-knit community app where students and professionals from different backgrounds can share their daily experiences in a not-so-formal way. 🌏
### PS: 👩🏻‍💻
This is the beta version of the app and the full fledged production is under construction. 🏗🚧👷🏻‍♀️ The final version will support a 'Buddy-Finder', a recommendation engine, event hosting, and much more. Connect with me on LinkedIn to talk more about Weave and become a part of the Loomers community. 🧵💙
