## Welcome to Weave's GitHub Repo
Hello, my name is Shreyanshi Bhatt and I am the founder of Weave. 🙋🏻‍♀️ 

## Description
Weave is a social media platform designed to connect international students, helping them share experiences, access study-abroad resources, and build community. It features country-specific post feeds, hashtag-based content discovery, interactive posts (like, comment, save), recent user highlights, and a fully responsive PWA experience with dark and light mode support. The platform includes a Buddy Matcher that intelligently pairs users based on shared interests to encourage meaningful connections. Future development focuses on integrating Agentic AI to offer personalized support and career exploration tools. ✨

## 1 Goal 
Empower international students & Make studying abroad easier. 🌏

## PS
This is the beta version of the app and the full-fledged production is under construction. 🏗🚧👷🏻‍♀️ Connect with me on LinkedIn to talk more about Weave and become a part of the Loomers community. 🧵💙
